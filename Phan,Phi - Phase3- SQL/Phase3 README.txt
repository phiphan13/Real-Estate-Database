PHASE 3 READ ME

PART A.1: Look at phan_schema.sql

PART A.2: To compile java code use "javac phan_inserts.java" 
            to run the code use "java phan_inserts"
            once the code is run, prompt the SAME name that are used for the table in
            A.1 when prompt to type in table name
            note: when prompt for path, it should look as the following or something similar
            "C:\Users\omegl\Desktop\Database2021\Phan-Phase3-IntrotoSql\realestateCSV\AGENT.csv"
            wherever the csv file of the table is located

            NOTE: If you are using a different CSV File, itll read boxes depending if your file reads it as UTF-8 or not:

PART A.3: Look at output.sql to run
        look at output.txt for output that should be given

PART B: Look at phan_partb


EXTRA CREDIT: 
We met multiple times via discord and in UNO Library to go over the code and queries.
We had trouble in a couple of areas, including differentiating between int or String and being able to read 
different types of CSV files without erasing the previous inserts and was able to work together to solve the problem.
